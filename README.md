# WikiLyse 2.0
WikiLyse started as a university project. However I found the
constraints on the project set out by the university to be unsatifactory
so I decided to rebuild the application.
Originally the project was undertaken as a group. The original app was worked on by:
* Me
* Viv Le
* Freddie Xu


Originally, the app was a simple MVC ExpressJS, Mongo app. The plan here is to expand
it to a full (at time of writing) MERN app.
